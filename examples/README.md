# Examples

Here are example scripts:

- [`example_1.c`](example_1.c) - Trains an ANN on the XOR function using backpropagation.
- [`example_2.c`](example_2.c) - Trains an ANN on the XOR function using random search.
- [`example_3.c`](example_3.c) - Loads and runs an ANN from a file.
- [`example_4.c`](example_4.c) - Trains an ANN on the [IRIS data-set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) using backpropagation.
- [`example_5.c`](example_5.c) - Visualization of Neural Network Approximation.

To run them, run make in the root directory, and run:
```
bash launcher.sh
```

> NOTE: *You always can just run the executables yourself.*

If you have issues with the permission, or the make file, please report this issue at the ***Issues*** tab. (make sure to see if the project successfully built from the main [README]([../README.md](https://github.com/dimaaac/DimaNet/edit/main/README.md) before reporting anything. if not, it might probably be an issue with your system or the make command it self)

To change the file's executable permission, execute:
```
chmod +x launcher.sh
```

> *You could've searched that up yourself...*
