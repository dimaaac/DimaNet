# DimaNet

DimaNet is a minimal library for training and using feedforward
artificial neural networks (ANN) in C. Its primary focus is on being simple,
fast, reliable, and hackable. It achieves this by providing only the necessary
functions and little extra.

## Building

To use DimaNet, you have to include: `dimanet.c` and `dimanet.h` as DimaNet is locally contained. Include the following files with 
```c
#include <dimanet.c> // Main DimaNet
#include <dimanet.h> // Header
```

## Yeah
that's all, for now
